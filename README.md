# MDIA-1620 by Donald Wong
A *cool* repository for my MDIA 1620 code.

---------
This is a **GREAT** repository!



**3 AHA MOMENTS**
1. I learned how to navigate through files with windows powershell
2. I learned what holding a piece of bread for a long period of time can do to my psyche
3. I learned that my teacher is a SimCity fan

*Two Things I am still unclear on*
1. Understanding the codes
2. Navigating through GitHub

## One word for how I'm feeling

**EXCITED**

## NEW 3, 2, 1s

**3 AHA MOMENTS**

1. I learned more about console logs.
2. I learned how to create *proper* javascripts
3. I'm getting better at going through windows powershell.

*Two things I am stil unclear on*

1. I still am not 100% on using terminal commands.
2. I am still a little bit lost when using the terminal.

> One word for how I am feeling

*Intrigued*

## 3 CONFUSING THINGS

1. I still struggle with pushing and pulling code, but I am slowly getting a grasp on it.
2. I am not the most well versed on arrays.
3. I still stuggle with adding a commit update to my code.

**Three solid grasps**

1. I have a ok understanding with console.logs
2. I understand how to make let structures
3. I can use if else statements.
