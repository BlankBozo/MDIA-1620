# MDIA-1620
A *cool* repository for my MDIA 1620 code.

---------
This is a **GREAT** repository!

**3 AHA MOMENTS**
1. I learned how to navigate through files with windows powershell
2. I learned what holding a piece of bread for a long period of time can do to my psyche
3. I learned that my teacher is a SimCity fan

*Two Things I am still unclear on*
1. Understanding the codes
2. Navigating through GitHub

## One word for how I'm feeling

**EXCITED**
